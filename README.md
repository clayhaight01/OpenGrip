## Overview

Robotics grippers are often seen as expensive, bulky, and challenging to integrate into projects. OpenGrip challenges this norm by offering a solution that is both affordable and user-friendly, without compromising on performance. 

### Key Features

- **Low Cost**: By using only 5 custom parts and affordable hardware, OpenGrip significantly reduces costs, making it accessible for a wide range of users and applications.
  
- **Compact and Efficient Design**: Unlike conventional grippers, OpenGrip's sleek design allows for easy integration into various robotic systems.

- **High Performance**: Despite its cost-effectiveness, OpenGrip competes with the performance of grippers that are up to 50 times more expensive.

- **Ease of Use**: The integration of a Dynamixel servo motor makes OpenGrip extremely user-friendly. It can be controlled through ROS or any other Dynamixel-compatible control methods, offering versatility and ease of integration.

## Getting Started

I may add instructions the next time I build one, but for now use the CAD assembly as a guide. A BOM can be found here:
